# Todolist-v2.0
The ToDolist v2.0 is all about the upgrade of version 1.0.Here we are adding a nosql database to store the data.
The Database used is MongoDB with ODM Mongoose.
<h2>Purpose</h2>
The purpose of the application is to store the data in the todolist in both home route and in custom List URL's entered by the user.
Here the user can delete the particular item instead of crossing it out.
